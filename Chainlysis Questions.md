####Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?

- Due to time constraints and having fatal errors when downloading react.js, I am not able to build a modern website with react.js. Instead, I chose to use php to track free crypto apis by parsing through the json generated by the apis. 

####Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)

- addind links that change the content area based on which link is displayed,

####If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?

- sql?

####What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation

- Furthermore, by choice of not implementing a sql database was also a short cut.
